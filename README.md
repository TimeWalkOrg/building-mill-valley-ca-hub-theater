# The Hub Theatre
142 Throckmorton Avenue, Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

The building at 142 Throckmorton was built in 1915. Originally housing the “Hub Theatre for showing silent films, The Hub closed in 1929 with sound films having been invented and played at the newly opened Sequoia Theater. In 1952, the building was bought by The Odd Fellows Temple, and in 1976, it became a movie theater again. This is where the first of the Mill Valley Film Festivals began. As of 2003, it is used as a theater for live performances under the name 142 Throckmorton Theatre.

During the Hub’s silent film era, “musical accompaniment was in the capable hands of Hattie Thompson at an electrically powered organ. Admission to a Saturday Matinee cost 5 cents. The showing included a Wild West Serial." Source: [Mill Valley Historical Society Vignette](https://www.mvhistory.org/vignette-142-throckmorton/)
